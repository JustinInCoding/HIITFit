> This project is for me to learn from kodeco's iOS book SwiftUI Apprentice. Here I try to grasp the knowledge of SwiftUI by recording the steps of building the app.

## Setup
Xcode - 15.4 (the version I created the project)

## Tips and Learned

- Xcode Tip: Delimiter auto-completion works for curly and square braces, parentheses and quotation marks: Select the text you want to enclose, then type the start delimiter character
- Control-Option-click the view to pop up its Attributes inspector
- Xcode Tip: The show-inspectors button (upper right toolbar) opens the right-hand panel. The Attributes inspector is the right-most tab in this panel. If youâ€™re working on a small screen and just want to edit one attribute, Control-Option-click a view in the code editor to use the pop-up inspector. It uses less space.
- use `tabViewStyle(PageTabViewStyle())` to make the tabs behave like pages
- `.indexViewStyle(PageIndexViewStyle(backgroundDisplayMode: .always))` to make the tabs show up
- creating and grouping project files
